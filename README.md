# Wild
Umbrella project (a virtual cargo workspace) for a couple of wild animals.
The common denominator for these projects is that they are all clients for the Lipa backend GraphQL API.

## Honey-badger
The honey *badger* provides you with a badge that authorizes you to access the backend API.  
It deals with the backends authentication flow and leaves you with a JWT token
that you can use in your HTTP header as a bearer token.

## Chameleon
The chameleon can change its color very quickly, it knows everything about exchange rates.
So it will fetch fiat exchange rates for you.

## Crow
Crows are known for their love to collect stuff.
The library allows to register for and list withdraw collect offers (e.g. Lightning Address).

## Squirrel
Squirrels love to store nuts for the winter.
The library allows backups of local data to be created.

## Parrot
This feathered companion, similar to its namesakes, repeats what he hears and as such delivers, 
important analytics data about payments to the backend. This data is pseudonymized and used to improve our services.

## Pigeon
Pigeons excel in orientation and have a remarkable ability to navigate addresses.
The library allows to register Lightning addresses and phone numbers as well as processing incoming payments sent to an address or number.
